# Project07_Adventure_Game

This project is an adventure game developed using TypeScript and Node.js. The game features a simple text-based interface where the player can move between different rooms, collect treasures, and manage their inventory.

The game is built using a modular architecture, with each room defined as an object that contains a description of the room, its neighboring rooms, and whether it contains a treasure or not. The game state is also defined as an object that keeps track of the current room and the player's inventory.

The game provides a few basic commands that the player can use to interact with the game, such as "go north", "go south", "go east", "go west", and "inventory". When the player moves to a new room, the game prints out the description of the new room and checks whether the room contains a treasure. If a treasure is found, it is added to the player's inventory.

The game is implemented using TypeScript, which provides type safety and a more robust development experience. It also uses Node.js's built-in readline module to handle user input and output.

This project is suitable for developers who want to learn TypeScript and build a simple game using Node.js. It can also serve as a starting point for more complex adventure games with more advanced features and mechanics.

Overall, this adventure game project is a fun and engaging way to learn TypeScript and Node.js, while also building a fully functional game that can be played by anyone with a terminal and a sense of adventure.
